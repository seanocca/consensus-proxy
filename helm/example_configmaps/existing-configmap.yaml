# Deployment using a pre-existing ConfigMap
# Useful when config is managed externally (e.g. GitOps, Sealed Secrets, or
# another team manages the beacon node configuration).

deployment:
  replicas: 2

  requests:
    cpu: 100m

# Reference a ConfigMap that already exists in the cluster.
# It must contain a `config.toml` key with valid TOML configuration.
configMap:
  existingConfigMap: my-consensus-proxy-config

# Alternatively, use a Secret for sensitive config (e.g. API keys):
#
# configMap:
#   enabled: false
#
# extraVolumes:
#   - name: config
#     secret:
#       secretName: consensus-proxy-secret
#
# extraVolumeMounts:
#   - name: config
#     mountPath: /etc/consensus-proxy
#     readOnly: true
